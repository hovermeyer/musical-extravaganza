ELIZA:
Alexander, come back to sleep

HAMILTON:
I have an early meeting out of town

ELIZA:
It's still dark outside

HAMILTON:
I know, I just need to write something down

ELIZA:
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

HAMILTON:
Shh

ELIZA:
Come back to bed, that would be enough

HAMILTON:
I'll be back before you know I'm gone

ELIZA:
Come back to sleep

HAMILTON:
This meeting's at dawn

ELIZA:
Well I'm going back to sleep

HAMILTON:
Hey, best of wives and best of women
