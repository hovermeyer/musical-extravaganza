SEABURY:
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury, and I present
"Free thoughts on the proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interest at heart

MULLIGAN:
Oh my god. Tear this dude apart

SEABURY:
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don’t let them lead you astray
This congress does not speak for me

BURR:
Let him be

SEABURY:
They’re playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame!

HAMILTON:
Yo!

SEABURY:
Heed not the rabble who

HAMILTON:
He'd have you all unravel at the sound of screams

SEABURY:
Scream—

HAMILTON:
But the revolution

SEABURY:
Revolution—

HAMILTON:
Is comin'

SEABURY:
They have not your interests

HAMILTON:
The have-nots are gonna win this

SEABURY:
At heart—

HAMILTON:
It’s hard to listen to you with a straight face

SEABURY:
Chaos and—

HAMILTON:
Chaos and bloodshed

SEABURY:
Bloodshed are not—

HAMILTON:
Already haunt us

SEABURY:
A solution—

HAMILTON:
Honestly, you shouldn’t even talk—

SEABURY:
Don’t let them lead you astray—

HAMILTON:
And what about Boston?
Look at the cost and all that we’ve lost
And you talk about Congress?

SEABURY:
This Congress does not speak for me

HAMILTON:
My dog speaks more eloquently than thee

SEABURY:
You’re playing a dangerous game

HAMILTON:
But strangely, your mange is the same!

SEABURY:
I pray the king shows you his mercy

HAMILTON:
Is he in Jersey?

SEABURY:
For shame—

HAMILTON:
For the Revolution!

SEABURY:
For shame!

COMPANY:
For the Revolution!

SEABURY:
Heed—

HAMILTON:
If you repeat yourself again I’m gonna

SEABURY and HAMILTON:
Scream—

HAMILTON:
Honestly, look at me, please don’t read!

SEABURY:
Not your interest—

HAMILTON:
Don’t modulate the key then not debate with me
Why should a tiny island across the sea
Regulate the price of tea?

BURR:
Alexander, please!

HAMILTON:
Burr, I’d rather be divisive than indecisive
Drop the niceties

ENSEMBLE:
Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!

FULL COMPANY:
A message from the King!
