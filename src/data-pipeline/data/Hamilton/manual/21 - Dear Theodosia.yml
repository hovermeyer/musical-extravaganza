BURR:
Dear Theodosia what to say to you
You have my eyes
You have your mother's name
When you came into the world you cried and it broke my heart

I'm dedicating everyday to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out I fall apart and I thought I was so smart

You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you
We'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you
We'll give the world to you and you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday
Yeah you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

HAMILTON:
Oh, Phillip when you smile I am undone, my son
Look at my son
Pride is not the word I'm looking for
There is so much more inside me now

Oh, Phillip you outshine the morning sun, my son
When you smile, I fall apart and I thought I was so smart

My father wasn't around

BURR:
My father wasn't around

HAMILTON:
I swear that

HAMILTON and BURR:
I'll be around for you

HAMILTON:
I'll do whatever it takes

BURR:
I'll make a million mistakes

HAMILTON and BURR:
I'll make the world safe and sound for you

You'll come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you
We'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you
We'll give the world to you and you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday
