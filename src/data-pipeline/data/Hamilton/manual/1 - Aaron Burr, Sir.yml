HAMILTON:
Pardon me, are you Aaron Burr, sir?

BURR:
That depends, who's asking?

HAMILTON:
Oh well sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton
I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

BURR:
I'm getting nervous

HAMILTON:
Sir, I heard your name at Princeton
I was seeking an accelerated course of study
When I got sort out of sorts with a buddy of yours
I may have punched him
It’s a blur, sir
He handles the financials—

BURR:
You punched the bursar?

HAMILTON:
Yes, I wanted to do what you did
Graduate in two, then join the revolution
He looked at me like I was stupid
I’m not stupid
So how’d you do it?
How’d you graduate so fast?

BURR:
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

HAMILTON:
You're an orphan
Of course, I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for

BURR:
Can I buy you a drink?

HAMILTON:
That would be nice

BURR:
While we’re talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

HAMILTON:
What?

BURR:
Smile more

HAMILTON:
Ha

BURR:
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

HAMILTON:
You can't be serious

BURR:
You want to get ahead?

HAMILTON:
Yes

BURR:
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

LAURENS:
Yo yo yo yo yo! What time is it?

LAURENS, MULLIGAN:
Showtime!

BURR:
...like I said...

LAURENS:
Showtime! Showtime! Yo!
I’m John Laurens in the place to be!
Uh, two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm working on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me
Cause I will pop chick-a-brap these cops 'til I'm free!

LAFAYETTE:
Ah oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the king, “Casse-toi!” Who's the best? C’est moi!

MULLIGAN:
Brrrah, brrrah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin’ it
Yes I heard your mother say “come again?”

LAURENS, LAFAYETTE:
Ayyyy

MULLIGAN:
Lock up your daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets

LAFAYETTE:
Wow

LAURENS:
No more sex
Pour me another brew, son!
Let’s raise a couple more

LAURENS, LAFAYETTE, MULLIGAN:
To the revolution!

LAURENS:
Well if it ain’t the prodigy of Princeton College

MULLIGAN:
Aaron Burr

LAURENS:
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge

BURR:
Good luck with that
You’re takin’ a stand
You spit, I’mma sit
We’ll see where we land

LAFAYETTE (MULLIGAN):
Boooo (Ohhhhhh)

LAURENS:
Burr, the revolution’s imminent
What do you stall for?

HAMILTON:
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what’ll you fall for?

LAURENS, MULLIGAN, LAFAYETTE:
Oooh

LAURENS:
Who are you?

MULLIGAN:
Who are you?

LAFAYETTE:
Who are you?

LAURENS, MULLIGAN, LAFAYETTE:
Who, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?
