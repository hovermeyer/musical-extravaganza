WASHINGTON:
Let me tell you what I wish I’d known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control:

WASHINGTON and COMPANY:
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

BURR:
President Jefferson:

JEFFERSON:
I’ll give him this: his financial system is a
Work of genius. I couldn’t undo it if I tried
And I tried

WASHINGTON and COMPANY:
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

BURR:
President Madison:

MADISON:
He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity
I hate to admit it, but he doesn’t get enough credit
For all the credit he gave us

WASHINGTON and COMPANY:
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

ANGELICA:
Every other founding father story gets told
Every other founding father gets to grow old

BURR:
But when you’re gone, who remembers your name?
Who keeps your flame?

BURR and MEN:
Who tells your story?

ANGELICA and WOMEN:
Who tells your story?
Your story?

BURR and MEN:
Who tells your story?

I put myself back in the narrative

I live another fifty years
It’s not enough

She tells our story

ELIZA:
I try to make sense of your thousands of pages of writings
You really do write like you’re running out of

ELIZA and COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
I rely on—

ELIZA and ANGELICA:
Angelica

ELIZA:
While she’s alive—

ELIZA and ANGELICA:
We tell your story

ELIZA:
She is buried in Trinity Church

ELIZA and ANGELICA:
Near you

ELIZA:
When I needed her most, she was right on

ELIZA and COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
And I’m still not through
I ask myself, “What would you do if you had more”

ELIZA and COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
The Lord, in his kindness
He gives me what you always wanted
He gives me more—

ELIZA and COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
I raise funds in D.C. for the Washington Monument

WASHINGTON:
She tells my story

ELIZA:
I speak out against slavery
You could have done so much more if you only had—

ELIZA and COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
And when my time is up, have I done enough?

ELIZA and COMPANY:
Will they tell our story?

ELIZA:
Oh. Can I show you what I’m proudest of?

COMPANY:
The orphanage

ELIZA:
I established the first private orphanage in New York City

COMPANY:
The orphanage

ELIZA:
I help to raise hundreds of children
I get to see them growing up

COMPANY:
The orphanage

ELIZA:
In their eyes I see you, Alexander
I see you every—

ELIZA and COMPANY:
Time

ELIZA:
And when my time is up
Have I done enough?

ELIZA and COMPANY:
Will they tell my story?

ELIZA:
Oh, I can’t wait to see you again
It’s only a matter of—

ELIZA and COMPANY:
Time

COMPANY:
Will they tell your story?
Time…
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?
Time…
Will they tell your story?
Time…
Who lives, who dies—

FULL COMPANY:
Who tells your story?
