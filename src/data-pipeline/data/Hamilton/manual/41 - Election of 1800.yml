COMPANY:
The Election of 1800

JEFFERSON:
Can we get back to politics?

JAMES MADISON:
Please?

JEFFERSON:
Yo…
Every action has its equal opposite reaction
John Adams shat the bed;
I love the guy, but he’s in traction
Poor Alexander Hamilton, he is missing in action
So now I’m facing

JEFFERSON and JAMES MADISON:
Aaron Burr

JEFFERSON:
with his own faction

JAMES MADISON:
He’s very attractive in the North,
New Yorkers like his chances

JEFFERSON:
He’s not very forthcoming on any particular stances

MADISON:
Ask him a question, it glances off,
he obfuscates, he dances

JEFFERSON:
And they say I’m a Francophile,
at least they know I know where France is

MADISON:
Thomas, that’s the problem; see,
they see Burr as a less extreme you
You need to change course,
a key endorsement might redeem you

JEFFERSON:
Who did you have in mind?

MADISON:
Don’t laugh

JEFFERSON:
Who is it?

MADISON:
You used to work on the same staff.

JEFFERSON:
Whaaaat?

MADISON:
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

JEFFERSON and MADISON:
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

AARON BURR and (ENSEMBLE):
Talk less! (Burr!)
Smile more! (Burr!)
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for! (Burr!)
Shake hands with him! (Burr!)
Charm her! (Burr!)
It’s 1800; ladies, tell your husbands, vote for Burr!

ENSEMBLE:
I don’t like Adams! Well, he’s gonna lose, that’s just defeatist.
And Jefferson? In love with France! Yeah, he’s so elitist!
I like that Aaron Burr! I can’t believe we’re here with him!
He seems approachable? Like you could grab a beer with him

ENSEMBLE and (ALEXANDER HAMILTON):
Dear Mr. Hamilton
Your fellow Federalists would like to know how you’ll be voting
(It’s quiet uptown…)
Dear Mr. Hamilton
John Adams doesn’t stand a chance,
so who you are you promoting?
(It’s quiet uptown…)
Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?
We know, it’s lose/lose
Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?
But if you had to choose…
Dear Mr. Hamilton
John Adams doesn’t stand a chance,
so who you are you promoting?
But if you had to choose!

HAMILTON:
Well, if isn’t Aaron Burr, sir.

BURR:
Alexander!

HAMILTON:
You’ve created quite a stir, sir.

BURR:
I’m going door to door!

HAMILTON:
You’re openly campaigning?

BURR:
Sure!

HAMILTON:
That’s new.

BURR:
Honestly, it’s kind of draining

HAMILTON:
Burr?

BURR:
Sir?

HAMILTON:
Is there anything you wouldn’t do?

BURR:
No, I’m chasing what I want, and you know what?

HAMILTON:
What?

BURR:
I learned that from you

ENSEMBLE:
If you had to choose, if you had to choose…

MADISON:
…It’s a tie

ENSEMBLE:
If you had to choose, if you had to choose…

JEFFERSON:
It’s up to the delegates

ENSEMBLE:
If you had to choose, if you had to choose…

JEFFERSON and MADISON:
It’s up to Hamilton!

ENSEMBLE:
If you had to choose, if you had to choose…
Jefferson or Burr? Jefferson or Burr?
Choose, choose, choose!

ALEXANDER HAMILTON and (ENSEMBLE):
Yo
(Oh!) The people are asking to hear my voice
(Oh!) But the country is facing a difficult choice
(Oh!) And you were to ask me who I’d promote…
(Oh!) …Jefferson has my vote
(Oh!) I have never agreed with Jefferson once…
(Oh!) We have fought on like 75 different fronts
(Oh!) But when all said and all is done…
Jefferson has beliefs; Burr has none

ENSEMBLE:
Ooooh!

JEFFERSON and MADISON:
Well, I’ll be damned! Well, I’ll be damned!

MADISON:
Hamilton’s on your side

ENSEMBLE:
Well, I’ll be damned! Well, I’ll be damned!

MADISON:
And… you won in a landslide

BURR:
Congrats on a race well won
I did give you a fight.

JEFFERSON:
Uh-huh…

BURR:
I look forward to our partnership.

JEFFERSON:
Our partnership?

BURR:
As your vice president!

JEFFERSON:
Yeah, right!

JEFFERSON:
You hear this guy?
Man openly campaigns against me,
talking ‘bout “I look forward to our partnership!”

MADISON:
It is crazy that the guy who comes in second gets to be vice president

JEFFERSON:
OOOH! Y’know what, we can change that! Y’know why?

MADISON:
Why?

JEFFERSON:
‘Cause I’m the president!
Burr…
When you see Hamilton,
thank him for the endorsement.
