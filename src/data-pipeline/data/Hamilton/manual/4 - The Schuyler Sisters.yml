BURR:
There’s nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slumming it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk at the students in the common
Just to watch ‘em talk

Take Philip Schuyler, the man is loaded
Uh oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at

COMPANY:
Work, work

ANGELICA:
Angelica!

COMPANY:
Work, work

ELIZA:

PEGGY:

ELIZA and PEGGY:

BURR:
Ooh, there’s nothing like summer in the city
Someone in a rush next to someone lookin' pretty
Excuse me, miss, I know it’s not funny
But your perfume smells like your daddy’s got money
Why you slummin’ in the city in your fancy heels?
You searchin’ for an urchin who can give you ideals?

ANGELICA:
Burr, you disgust me

BURR:
Ah, so you’ve discussed me
I’m a trust fund, baby, you can trust me

ANGELICA:
I’ve been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
So men say that I’m intense or I’m insane
You want a revolution? I want a revelation
So listen to my declaration:

ANGELICA, ELIZA and PEGGY:
"We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal"

ANGELICA and (COMPANY):
And when I meet Thomas Jefferson (unh!)
I’mma compel him to include women in the sequel

Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now

ELIZA and PEGGY:
Look around, look around at how
Lucky we are to be alive right now

Just happen to be in the greatest city in the world
