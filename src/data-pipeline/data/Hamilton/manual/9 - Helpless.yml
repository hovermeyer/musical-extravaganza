Ohh, I do I do I do I (Hey hey hey hey)
Dooo! Hey! (Hey hey hey hey)
Ohh, I do I do I do I (Hey hey hey hey)
Dooo! Boy you got me (Hey hey hey)

ELIZA and WOMEN:
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky’s the limit I’m helpless!
Down for the count, and I’m drownin’ in ‘em

ELIZA:
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin’ at my sister as she’s dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went “Boom!”
Tryin’ to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody’s dancin’ and the band’s top volume

ELIZA and WOMEN:
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine

ELIZA and (WOMEN):
Grab my sister, and
Whisper, “Yo, this One’s
mine.”
(Oooh)
My sister made her way across
the room to you (Oooh)
And I got nervous,
thinking “What’s she gonna do?” (Oooh)
She grabbed you by the arm,
I’m thinkin’ “I’m through” (Oooh)
Then you look back at me
and suddenly I’m Helpless! (Helpless!)

Oh, look at those eyes (Look into your eyes)
(And the sky’s the limit)
Oh! (I’m)
Yeah, I’m (Helpless!)
Helpless, I know (Down for the count)
(And I’m drownin’ in ‘em)
(I’m helpless!)
I’m so into you (Look into your eyes)
I am so into you (And the sky’s the limit I’m helpless!)


I know I’m down for the count (Down for the count)
And I’m drownin’ in ‘em. (And I’m drownin’ in ‘em.)

HAMILTON:
Where are you taking me?

ANGELICA:
I’m about to change your life

HAMILTON:
Then by all means, lead the way

ELIZA:
Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you

HAMILTON:
Schuyler?

ANGELICA:
My sister

ELIZA:
Thank you for all your service

HAMILTON:
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

ANGELICA:
I’ll leave you to it

ELIZA and WOMEN:
One week later

ELIZA:
I’m writin’ a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin’ at my sister, cuz she wants to form a harem

ANGELICA:
I’m just sayin’, if you really loved me, you would share him

ELIZA and (ALL WOMEN):
Ha!
Two weeks later
In the living room stressin’ (Stressin’)
My father’s stone-faced
While you’re asking for his blessin’ (Blessin’)
I’m dying inside, as
You wine
And dine
And I’m tryin’ not to cry
‘cause there’s nothing
that your mind can’t do (Oooh)
My father makes his way across the room
To you
I panic for a second, thinking
“we’re through” (Oooh)
But then he shakes your hand and says
“Be true” (Oooh)
And you turn back to me, smiling, and I’m

WOMEN:
Helpless!
Look into your eyes
And the sky’s the
Limit I’m

ELIZA and WOMEN:
Helpless!

ELIZA and WOMEN:
Down for the count
And I’m drownin’ in
‘em I’m
Helpless!

ELIZA and (WOMEN):
That boy is mine
That boy is mine! (Look into your eyes)
(And the sky’s the)
(Limit I’m)
Helpless! (Helpless!)

ELIZA and WOMEN:
Down for the count
And I’m drownin’ in em

HAMILTON:
Eliza, I don’t have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have’s my honor, a tolerance for Paine
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We’ll get a little place in Harlem and we’ll figure it out
I’ve been livin’ without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I’ll never forget my mother’s face, that was real
And long as I’m alive, Eliza, swear to God
You’ll never feel so…

ALL WOMEN:
Helpless!

ELIZA:
I do I do I do I do!

HAMILTON:
Eliza…

ALL WOMEN:
Helpless!

ELIZA:
I do I do I do I do!

HAMILTON:
I’ve never felt so—

ELIZA and (ALL WOMEN):
Hey (Helpless!)
yeah, yeah!

ALL WOMEN:
Down for the count

ELIZA and (ALL WOMEN):
I’m down for the count (And I’m drownin’ in ‘em)
I’m—

HAMILTON and (ALL WOMEN):
My life is goin’ (Helpless!)
be fine cuz
Eliza’s in it.

ELIZA and (ALL WOMEN):
I look into your eyes, (Helpless!)
and the sky’s the limit
I’m— (Helpless!)

ALL WOMEN:
Down for the count

ELIZA and (ALL WOMEN):
…drownin’ in ‘em. (And I’m drownin’ in ‘em.)

ALL WOMEN:
In New York, you can be a new man…
In New York, you can be a new man…
In New York, you can be a new man…

ELIZA:
Helpless
