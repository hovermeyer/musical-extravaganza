LAURENS:
I may not live to see our glory

ELIZA:
Alexander, there's a letter for you from South Carolina

LAURENS:
But I will gladly join the fight

HAMILTON:
It's from John Laurens. I'll read it later

ELIZA:
No, it's not

LAURENS:
And when our children tell our story

HAMILTON:
Will you read it?

LAURENS:
They'll tell the story of tonight

ELIZA:
"On Tuesday, the twenty-seventh,
Lieutenant Colonel John Laurens was killed in a gunfight
against British troops in South Carolina.
These troops had not yet received word
from Yorktown that the war was over.
He's buried here until his family can send for his remains.
As you may know,
Lieutenant Colonel Laurens was engaged in recruiting three
thousand men for the first all-black military regiment.
The surviving members of this regiment
have been returned to their masters."

LAURENS:
Tomorrow there'll be more of us

ELIZA:
Alexander, are you alright?

HAMILTON:
I have so much work to do
