BURR:
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross’ flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who’s unafraid to step in!
He’s constantly confusin’, confoundin’ the British henchmen
Ev’ryone give it up for America’s favorite fighting Frenchman!

COMPANY:
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE:
I’m takin this horse by the reins makin’
Redcoats redder with bloodstains

COMPANY:
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE:
And I’m never gonna stop until I make ‘em
Drop and burn ‘em up and scatter their remains, I’m

COMPANY:
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE:
Watch me engagin’ em! Escapin’ em!
Enragin’ em! I’m—

COMPANY:
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE:
I go to France for more funds

COMPANY:
Lafayette!

LAFAYETTE:
I come back with more

LAFAYETTE and ENSEMBLE:
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

WASHINGTON:
We rendezvous with Rochambeau, consolidate their gifts

LAFAYETTE:
We can end this war at Yorktown, cut them off at sea, but
For this to succeed, there is someone else we need:

WASHINGTON:
I know

WASHINGTON and COMPANY:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE:
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, I mean—

WASHINGTON and COMPANY:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE:
Sir, you’re gonna have to use him eventually
What’s he gonna do on the bench? I mean—

WASHINGTON and COMPANY:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE:
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance—

WASHINGTON and COMPANY:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE:
You wanna fight for your land back?

COMPANY:
Hamilton!

WASHINGTON:
I need my right hand man back!

WOMEN:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE and (MEN):
Ah! Uh, get ya right hand man back (Get your right hand man back!)

WOMEN:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE and (MEN):
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back (Your right hand man back!)

WOMEN:
Hamilton!

LAFAYETTE and (WOMEN):
I mean you gotta put
some thought into the letter (Ha—)
but the sooner the better (Ha—)
To get your right hand man back!

WOMEN, MEN:
Hamilton, Hamilton!
Ha— ha—!

WASHINGTON:
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers that will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They’ll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander…
