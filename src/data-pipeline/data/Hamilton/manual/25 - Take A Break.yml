ELIZA:
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

PHILIP:
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

ELIZA:
Good! Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

PHILIP:
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf

ELIZA:
Sept huit neuf

PHILIP:
Sept huit neuf

ELIZA:
Sept huit neuf

PHILIP:
Sept huit neuf

ELIZA and PHILIP:
One two three four five six seven eight nine!

HAMILTON:
My dearest, Angelica
“Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day”
I trust you’ll understand the reference to
Another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
I’m a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain
Madison is Banquo, Jefferson’s Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane

HAMILTON and ANGELICA:
And there you are, an ocean away
Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside
Then I get another letter
I cannot put the notion away…

ELIZA:
Take a break

HAMILTON:
I am on my way

ELIZA:
There’s a little surprise before supper
And it cannot wait

HAMILTON:
I’ll be there in just a minute, save my plate

ELIZA:
Alexander

HAMILTON:
Okay, okay

ELIZA:
Your son is nine years old today
Has something he’d like to say
He’s been practicing all day
Philip, take it away

PHILIP:
Daddy, daddy, look
My name is Philip
I am a poet
I wrote this poem just
To show it
And I just turned nine
You can write rhymes
But you can’t write mine

HAMILTON:
What!

PHILIP:
I practice French
And play piano with my mother

HAMILTON:
Uh-huh!

PHILIP:
I have a sister, but I want a little brother

HAMILTON:
Okay!

PHILIP:
My daddy’s trying to start America’s bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq!

HAMILTON:
Bravo!

ELIZA:
Take a break

HAMILTON:
Hey, our kid is pretty great

ELIZA:
Run away with us for the summer
Let’s go upstate

HAMILTON:
Eliza, I’ve got so much on my plate

ELIZA:
We can all go stay with my father
There’s a lake I know…

HAMILTON:
I know

ELIZA:
In a nearby park

HAMILTON:
I’d love to go

ELIZA:
You and I can go when the night gets dark…

HAMILTON:
I will try to get away

ANGELICA:
My dearest Alexander
You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise
Don’t stop ‘til you agree
Your fav’rite older sister
Angelica, reminds you
There’s someone in your corner all the way across the sea

In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase
It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and you’ve consumed my waking days
It says:

HAMILTON and ANGELICA:
“My dearest Angelica”

ANGELICA:
With a comma after “dearest.” You’ve written

HAMILTON and ANGELICA:
“My dearest, Angelica.”

ANGELICA:
Anyway, all this to say
I’m coming home this summer
At my sister’s invitation
I’ll be there with your fam’ly
If you make your way upstate
I know you’re very busy
I know your work’s important
But I’m crossing the ocean and I just can’t wait

HAMILTON and ANGELICA:
You won’t be an ocean away
You will only be a moment away…

ELIZA:
Alexander, come downstairs. Angelica’s arriving today! Angelica!

ANGELICA:
Eliza!

HAMILTON:
The Schuyler sisters!

ANGELICA:
Alexander

HAMILTON:
Hi

ANGELICA:
It’s good to see your face

ELIZA:
Angelica, tell this man John Adams spends the summer with his family

HAMILTON:
Angelica, tell my wife John Adams doesn’t have a real job anyway

ANGELICA:
…you’re not joining us? Wait

HAMILTON:
I’m afraid I cannot join you upstate

ANGELICA:
Alexander, I came all this way

ELIZA:
She came all this way

ANGELICA:
All this way

ELIZA and ANGELICA:
Take a break

HAMILTON:
You know I have to get my plan through Congress

ELIZA and ANGELICA:
Run away with us for the summer
Let’s go upstate

HAMILTON:
I lose my job if I don’t get my plan through Congress

ELIZA and ANGELICA:
We can all go stay with our father

ELIZA:
There’s a lake I know

ANGELICA:
I know I’ll miss your face

ELIZA:
In a nearby park

ANGELICA:
Screw your courage to the sticking place

ELIZA:
You and I can go

ANGELICA:
Eliza’s right

ELIZA and ANGELICA:
Take a break and get away

ANGELICA:
Run away with us for the summer

ELIZA:
Let’s go upstate
Where we can stay

ANGELICA:
We can all go stay with our father
If you take your time

ELIZA:
Look around, look around
At how lucky we are to be alive right now

ANGELICA:
You will make your mark
Close your eyes and dream

ELIZA:
We can go

ELIZA and ANGELICA:
When the night gets dark
Take a break.

HAMILTON:
I have to get my plan through Congress
I can’t stop until I get this plan through Congress
