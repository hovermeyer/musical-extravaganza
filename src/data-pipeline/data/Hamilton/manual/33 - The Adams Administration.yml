BURR:
How does Hamilton,
The short-tempered, protean creator
Of the coast guard,
Founder of the New York Post
Ardently abuse his cabinet post
Destroy his reputation?
Welcome folks, to the Adams Administration.
Jefferson’s the runner-up
Which makes him the vice-president,

MADISON:
Washington can’t help you now,
No more Mr. nice President

BURR:
Adams fires Hamilton,
Privately calls him creole bastard in his taunts

JEFFERSON:
Say what?

BURR:
Hamilton publishes his response.

HAMILTON:
Sit down John,
You fat mother-fucker.

JEFFERSON:
Hamilton’s out of control,

MADISON:
This is great:
He’s out of power,
He holds no office
And he just destroyed president John Adams
The only other significant member of his party

JEFFERSON:
Hamilton is a host unto himself,
As long as he can hold a pen,
He’s a threat.
Let’s let him know what we know.
