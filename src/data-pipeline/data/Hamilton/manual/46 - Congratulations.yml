HAMILTON:
Angelica...

ANGELICA:
Alexander...

Congratulations;
You've invented a new kind of stupid
A damage you can never undo
Kind of stupid
An open all the cages in the zoo
Kind of stupid
Clearly, you didn't think this through,
Kind of stupid

Let's review

You took a rumor a few
Maybe two people knew
And refuted it by sharing an affair
Of which no one had accused you
I begged you to take a break
You refused to

So scared of what your enemies will do to you
But you're the only enemy you ever seem to lose to!
You know, Jefferson can do what he wants
He doesn't dignify schoolyard taunts with a response!
So yeah, congratulations!

HAMILTON:
Angelica...

ANGELICA:
You've redefined your legacy, congratulations!

HAMILTON:
It was an act of political sacrifice!

ANGELICA:
...Sacrifice?

I languished in a loveless marriage in London
I lived only to read your letters
I look at us and think,
"God, what have we done with our lives,
And what did it get us?"

That doesn't wipe the tears or the years away
But I'm back in the city
And I'm here to stay

You know what I'm here to do?

HAMILTON:
Angelica...

ANGELICA:
I'm not here for you...

I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
And a million years ago
She said,
"This one's mine,"
So I,
Stood by...

Do you know why?!

I love my sister more than anything in this life!
I would choose her happiness over mine
Every time
Eliza!
Is the best thing in our lives
And never lose sight of the fact
That you have been blessed with the best wife!

Congratulations
For the rest of your life!
Every sacrifice is for my sister
Give her the best life!

Congratulations.
