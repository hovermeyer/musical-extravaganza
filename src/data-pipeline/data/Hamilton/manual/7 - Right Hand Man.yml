ENSEMBLE and (MALE ENSEMBLE):
British Admiral Howe's got troops on the water
Thirty-two thousand troops in New York Harbor
Thirty-two thousand troops in New York Harbor (Thirty-two thousand troops in New York Harbor)
When they surround our troops (they surround our troops)
When they surround our troops

HAMILTON:
As a kid in the Caribbean
I wished for a war
I knew that I was poor
I knew that it was the only way to

HAMILTON and (MALE ENSEMBLE):
Rise Up!

HAMILTON:
If they tell my story
I am either going to die on the battlefield in glory or

HAMILTON and (MALE ENSEMBLE):
Rise Up!

HAMILTON:
I will fight for this land
but there is only one man
who can give us a command
so we can

HAMILTON and (MALE ENSEMBLE):
Rise Up!

HAMILTON:
Understand
It's the only way to

HAMILTON and (MALE ENSEMBLE):
Rise Up!
Rise Up!

HAMILTON:
Here he comes

Company:
Here comes the General!

BURR:
Ladies and Gentlemen

Company:
Here comes the General!

BURR:
The moment you've been waiting for!

Company:
Here comes the General!

BURR:
The pride of Mount Vernon

Company:
Here comes the General!

BURR:
George Washington!

WASHINGTON and (ENSEMBLE):
We are outgunned (What?)
Outmanned (What?)
Outnumbered
Outplanned
(Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)
We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I’m gonna need a
right-hand man.
(Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)

WASHINGTON:
Check it—
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I’m the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin’ letters to relatives
Embellishin’ my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go…

ENSEMBLE:
Boom!

WASHINGTON:
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I’m
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look

WASHINGTON and (ENSEMBLE):
We are outgunned (What?)
Outmanned (What?)
Outnumbered
Outplanned
(Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)
We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I’m gonna need a
right-hand man.
(Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)
Incoming!

HAMILTON:
They’re battering down the Battery check the damages

MULLIGAN:
Rah!

HAMILTON:
We gotta stop ‘em and rob ‘em of their advantages

MULLIGAN:
Rah!

HAMILTON:
Let’s take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won’t abandon ship
Yo, let’s steal their cannons—

MULLIGAN and (COMPANY):
Shh-boom! (Boom!)

WASHINGTON:
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and…

COMPANY:
Boom!

WASHINGTON:
Goes the cannon, we’re abandonin’ Kips Bay and…

COMPANY:
Boom!

WASHINGTON:
There’s another ship and…

COMPANY:
Boom!

WASHINGTON:
We just lost the southern tip and…

COMPANY:
Boom!

WASHINGTON:
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can’t afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they’re skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I’m in dire need of assistance…

BURR:
Your excellency, sir!

WASHINGTON:
Who are you?

BURR:
Aaron Burr, Sir?
Permission to state my case?

WASHINGTON:
As you were

BURR:
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

WASHINGTON:
Huh

BURR:
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions
on how to fight instead of fleeing west

WASHINGTON:
Yes?

BURR:
Well—

HAMILTON:
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

WASHINGTON:
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

HAMILTON:
Yes, sir

HAMILTON and BURR:
We keep meeting

BURR:
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

WASHINGTON:
Burr?

BURR:
Sir?

WASHINGTON:
Close the door on your way out

HAMILTON:
Have I done something wrong, sir?

WASHINGTON:
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

HAMILTON:
Sir?

WASHINGTON:
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

HAMILTON:
Sir!

WASHINGTON:
Don’t get me wrong, you’re a young man, of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathanael Greene and Henry Knox wanted to hire you...

HAMILTON:
To be their Secretary? I don’t think so

WASHINGTON:
Why’re you upset?

HAMILTON:
I’m not—

WASHINGTON:
It’s alright, you want to fight, you’ve got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin’ like a martyr?

HAMILTON:
Yes

WASHINGTON:
Dying is easy, young man. Living is harder

HAMILTON:
Why are you telling me this?

WASHINGTON:
I’m being honest
I’m working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

COMPANY (EXCEPT HAMILTON):
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
I am not throwin’ away my shot!
Ayo, I’m just like my country, I’m young
Scrappy and hungry!

HAMILTON:
I am not throwing away my shot!

WASHINGTON:
Son

WASHINGTON and COMPANY:
We are outgunned, outmanned!

HAMILTON:
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

WASHINGTON and COMPANY:
Outnumbered, outplanned!

HAMILTON:
We’ll need some spies on the inside
Some King’s men who might let some things slide

COMPANY:
Boom!

HAMILTON and (ELIZA, ANGELICA and PEGGY):
I’ll write to Congress (Whoa, whoa, whoa...)
and tell ‘em we need supplies,
you rally the guys,
master the element
of surprise

COMPANY:
Chick-a-boom!

HAMILTON and (ELIZA, ANGELICA and PEGGY):
I’ll rise above my (Whoa, whoa, whoa...)
station, organize
your information, ‘til
we rise to the occasion
of our new nation. Sir!

ENSEMBLE:
Here comes the General!

HAMILTON:
Rise up!

LAURENS, LAFAYETTE and MULLIGAN:
What?

ENSEMBLE:
Here comes the General!

HAMILTON, ANGELICA, ELIZA and PEGGY:
Rise up!

LAURENS, LAFAYETTE and MULLIGAN:
What?

ENSEMBLE:
Here comes the General!

HAMILTON, ANGELICA, ELIZA and PEGGY:
Rise up!

LAURENS, LAFAYETTE and MULLIGAN:
What?

ENSEMBLE:
Here comes the General!

HAMILTON:
What?

WASHINGTON:
And his right hand man!

FULL COMPANY:
Boom!
