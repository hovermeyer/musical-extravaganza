HAMILTON:
Where’s my son?

DOCTOR:
Mr. Hamilton, come in.
They brought him in a half an hour ago.
He lost a lot of blood on the way over.

ENSEMBLE WOMEN:
Stay alive...

HAMILTON:
Is he alive?

DOCTOR:
Yes. But you have to understand
The bullet entered just above his hip and
Lodged in his right arm

HAMILTON:
Can I see him please?

DOCTOR:
I’m doing ev’rything I can, but the wound was
Already infected when he arrived—

HAMILTON:
Philip

I held my head up high

HAMILTON:
I know, I know. Shh

Shh. I know you did
Ev’rything just right

Even before we got to ten

HAMILTON:

Stay alive…
