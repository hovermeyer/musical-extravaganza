KING GEORGE III:
They say,
George Washington's yielding his power and stepping away

Is that true?
I wasn't aware that was something a person could do

I'm perplexed.
Are they going to keep on replacing whoever's in charge?
If so who's next?
There's nobody else in their country who looms quite as large

John Adams?

I know him
That can't be
That's that little guy who spoke to me all those years ago
What was it '85?
That poor man they're going to eat him alive

Ocean's rise, empires fall
Next to Washington they all look small

All alone watch them run
They will tear each other in to pieces Jesus Christ this will be fun

Da da da da da
Da da da da dayada
Da da da da dayada

President John Adams,
Good luck!
