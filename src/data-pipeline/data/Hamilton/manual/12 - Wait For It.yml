BURR:
Theodosia writes me a letter ev'ry day.
I'm keeping her bed warm while her husband is away.
He's on the British side of Georgia.
He's tryin' to keep the colonies in line.
He can keep all of Georgia.
Theodosia, she's mine.

Love doesn't discriminate
between the sinners
and the saints,
it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep loving anyway.

We laugh and we cry
and we break
and we make our mistakes.
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
when so many have tried
then I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm willing to wait for it.

My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher,

When they died they left no instructions.
Just a legacy to protect.

BURR and ENSEMBLE:
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints,
it takes and it takes and it takes
and we keep living anyway.
We rise and we fall
and we break
and we make our mistakes.
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
when everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm willing to wait for it.
Wait for it.

Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

ENSEMBLE:
Climb

He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose

BURR:
Hamilton's pace is relentless

BURR:
What is it like in his shoes?
Hamilton doesn't hesitate.
He exhibits no restraint.
He takes and he takes and he takes
and he keeps winning anyway.
He changes the game.
He plays and he raises the stakes.
And if there's a reason
he seems to thrive when so few survive,
then God dammit

BURR and ENSEMBLE:
I'm willing to wait for it.
I'm willing to-

BURR:
