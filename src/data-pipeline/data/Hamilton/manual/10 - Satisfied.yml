By your side!

ANGELICA and (ALL MEN and WOMEN):
To your union,
(To the union!)
(To the revolution!)
and the hope that you provide.
(You provide! You provide)
May you always...

HAMILTON and MEN:
Always–

ANGELICA:
be satisfied.

HAMILTON and MEN:
Rewind–

ANGELICA:
I remember that night,
I just might regret that night for the rest of my days.
I remember those soldier boys tripping
Over themselves to win our praise.
I remember that dreamlike candlelight like a dream
That you can’t quite place,
but Alexander, I’ll never forget the first time I saw your face.
I have never been the same,
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame,
And when you said “Hi,” I forgot my dang name,
Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame,

FULL COMPANY:
This is not a game…

HAMILTON:
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied.

ANGELICA:
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean. You forget yourself.

HAMILTON:
You’re like me. I’m never satisfied.

ANGELICA:
Is that right?

HAMILTON:
I have never been satisfied.

ANGELICA:
My name is Angelica Schuyler.

HAMILTON:
Alexander Hamilton.

ANGELICA:
Where’s your fam’ly from?

HAMILTON:
Unimportant.
There’s a million things I haven’t done but just you wait,
Just you wait…

ANGELICA:
So so so— so this is what it feels like
To match wits with someone at your level!
What the hell is the catch?
It’s the feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light,
It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes,
Maybe three minutes,
Everything we said in total agreement,
It’s a dream and it’s a bit of a dance,
A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance.
He’s a bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give it a chance.
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants.
Handsome, boy, does he know it! Peach fuzz,
And he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place,
Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is...

ELIZA:
Helpless…

ANGELICA:
And I know she is...

ELIZA:
Helpless…

ANGELICA:
And her eyes are just…

ELIZA:
Helpless…

ANGELICA:
And I realize

ANGELICA and COMPANY:
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time…

HAMILTON:
Where are you taking me?

ANGELICA:
I’m about to change your life.

HAMILTON:
Then by all means, lead the way.

COMPANY (EXCEPT ANGELICA):
Number one!

ANGELICA:
I’m a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich.
My father has no sons so
I’m the one who has to social climb for one,
So I’m the oldest and the wittiest
And the gossip in New York City is insidious,
Alexander is penniless, Ha!
That doesn’t mean I want him any less.

ELIZA:
Elizabeth Schuyler. It’s a pleasure to meet you.

HAMILTON:
Schuyler?

ANGELICA:
My sister.

COMPANY:
Number two!

ANGELICA:
He’s after me cuz I’m a Schuyler sister.
That elevates his status,
I’d have to be naïve to set that aside,
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza,
Now that’s his bride.
Nice going, Angelica, he was right,
You will never be satisfied.

ELIZA:
Thank you for all your service.

HAMILTON:
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet,
It will have been worth it.

ANGELICA:
I’ll leave you to it.

COMPANY:
Number three!

ANGELICA:
I know my sister like I know my own mind,
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind.
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned,
He’d be mine. She would say, “I’m fine”

ANGELICA and COMPANY:
She’d be lying.

ANGELICA:
But when I fantasize at night it’s Alexander’s eyes,
As I romanticize what might have been
If I hadn’t sized him up so quickly.
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life…

ANGELICA and ALL MEN (EXCEPT HAMILTON):
To the groom! To the groom! To the groom!

ANGELICA:
To the bride!

ALL WOMEN (EXCEPT ELIZA):
To the bride! To the bride! To the bride!

ANGELICA:
From your sister,

ELIZA and WOMEN:
Angelica! Angelica!

ANGELICA:
who is always by your side.

WOMEN:
By your side.
By your side.

ANGELICA and (ENSEMBLE):
To your union, (To the union! To the revolution!)
and the hope that you provide. (You provide! You provide!)
May you always (always)
be satisfied. (be satisfied, be satisfied, be satisfied)
And I know (be satisfied, be satisfied, be satisfied)
She’ll be happy as (be satisfied, be satisfied, be satisfied)
His bride. And I know (be satisfied, be satisfied, be satisfied)
He will never be satisfied. I will never be satisfied.
