REUBEN:
Father we've something to tell you, a story of our time
A tragic but inspiring tale of manhood in its prime
You know you had a dozen sons -
Well now that's not quite true
But feel no sorrow, do not grieve,
He would not want you to

REUBEN, REUBEN'S WIFE and MALE ENSEMBLE:
There's one more angel in heaven
There's one more star in the sky
Joseph we'll never forget you
It's tough but we're gonna get by
There's one less place at our table
There's one more tear in my eye

BROTHERS:
But Joseph the things that you stood for

REUBEN:
Like peace and love never die
When I think of his last great battle
A lump comes to my throat
It takes a man who knows no fear
To wrestle with a goat
His blood-stained coat is tribute to
His final sacrifice
His body may be past its peak
But his soul's in paradise

JACOB:
There's one less place at our table
There's one more tear in my eye

BROTHERS:
But Joseph the things that you stood for

REUBEN:
Like truth and light never die

BROTHERS:
Carve his name with pride and courage

NAPHTALI:
Let no tear be shed

BROTHERS:
If he had not laid down his life
We all would now be dead
