JACOB:
Joseph's mother, she was quite my favourite wife
I never really loved another all my life
And Joseph was my joy because
He reminded me of her

NARRATOR:
Through young Joseph, Jacob lived his youth again
Loved him, praised him, gave him all he could, but then
It made the rest feel second best
And even if they were -

BROTHERS:
Being told we're also-rans
Does not make us Joseph fans

NARRATOR:
But where they had really missed the boat is

BROTHERS:
We're great guys but no-one seems to notice

NARRATOR:
Joseph's charm and winning smile
Failed to slay them in the aisle
And his father couldn't see the danger
He could not imagine any danger
He just saw in Joseph all his dreams come true
Jacob wanted to show the world he loved his son
To make it clear that Joseph was the special one
So Jacob bought his son a coat
A multi-coloured coat to wear

BROTHERS and FEMALE ENSEMBLE:
Joseph's coat was elegant,
The cut was fine
The tasteful style was the
Ultimate in good design
And this is why it caught the eye
A king would stop and stare

NARRATOR:
And when Joseph tried it on
He knew his sheepskin days were gone

NARRATOR and FEMALE ENSEMBLE and CHILDREN:
Such a dazzling coat of many colours
How he loved his coat of many colours

NARRATOR:
In a class above the rest
It even went well with his vest
Such a stunning coat of many colours
How he loved his coat of many colours
It was red and yellow and green and
Brown and blue
Joseph's brothers weren't
Too pleased with what they saw

BROTHERS:
We have never liked him
All that much before
And now this coat
Has got our goat
We feel life is unfair

NARRATOR, FEMALE ENSEMBLE and CHILDREN:
And when Joseph graced the scene
His brothers turned a shade of green
His astounding clothing took the biscuit

BROTHERS:
Quite the smoothest person in the district

JOSEPH and FEMALE ENSEMBLE:
I look handsome, I look smart
I am walking work of art
Such a dazzling coat of colours
How I love my coat of many colours

NARRATOR, JOSEPH, ENSEMBLE and CHILDREN:
It was red and yellow and green and brown
And scarlet and black and ochre and peach
And ruby and olive and violet and fawn
And lilac and gold and chocolate and mauve
And cream and crimson and silver and rose
And azure and lemon and russet and grey
And purple and white and pink and orange
And red and yellow and green and brown and
Scarlet and black and ochre and peach
And ruby and olive and violet and fawn
And lilac and gold and chocolate and mauve
And cream and crimson and silver and rose
And azure and lemon and russet and grey
And purple and white and pink and orange
And blue
